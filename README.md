### Calculist 2
#### by Dan Gallagher
##### v1.0.0
##### License: MIT

This web application is designed to act like a calculator with the exception you can take any of your calculations and add them to to a list. Each item can be given a title and saved for use later. This is can be re-ordered as needed.

**Current version includes:**

- Working clickable or touch calculator
- Equation solver for complex non-parentheses equations
- List item addition to saving calculations
- Renaming and Reordering of list items
- Both backspace and clear all buttons

**Future version may include:**

- More intuitive focus control (avoids second clicks to focus on changes)
- More intutive controls (like backspace with long hold clear all)
- Keyboard support for the calculator
- Persistent state via a Firebase user authentication and database

_Currently under conctruction_

_I intend this to be an Angular app with user login using a Firebase database._

_We shall see how that plan works out_
