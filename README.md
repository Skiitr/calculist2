This web application is designed to act like a calculator with the exception you can take any of your calculations and add them to to a list. Each item can be given a title and saved for use later. This is can be re-ordered as needed.

_Currently under conctruction_
_I intend to adapt this to be an Angular app with user login using a Firebase database._
_We shall see how that plan works out_
